		<h2>What's my solution?</h2>
		<p>
			My solution came from how John Leon implemented his social stream for the Delight FTW page, written in a way
			as to be modular and easily placed into a .NET website.
		</p>
		<p>
			I create a "SocialItem" object in .NET that is a generic
			social object with the fields I need and that are applicable to all social networks. I then have a service
			that runs (in this case Sitecore) that makes all the necessary API calls and loads them into a Database as
			SocialItem's.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the rendering of the page I obtain a collection of SocialItem's and display them however is necessary
			to the end user.
