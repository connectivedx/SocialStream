		<h2>Pros</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>One solution for working with multiple social networks.</li>
			<li>Easily plugged into and tinkered with to meet your specific needs.</li>
			<li>Let's your users share their experiences with fellow users.</li>
			<li>Pairs well with social campaigns and targeted hashtags.</li>
			<li>Can be dropped into virtually any .NET website (Sitecore or not) and run outside of a CMS' constraints.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h2>Cons</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Every single social API is different and requires it's own setup.</li>
			<li>No easy way to modularize this for generic use without locking out functionality or becoming obese.</li>
			<li>Requires updates when the APIs get updated.</li>
			<li>OAuth was created to cause pain and suffering.</li>
			<li>Potentially requires monitoring for innappropriate posts (this may be built in better at a later date).*</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			* With the speed some social streams bring in new information it get's buried extremely quickly, not to mention most social networks have some sort of innapropraite post protection built in.
